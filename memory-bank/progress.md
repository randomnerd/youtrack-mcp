# YouTrack MCP Progress

## What Works
Based on initial code review, the project appears to have implemented:
- Basic MCP server setup with the MCP protocol SDK
- Route registration for boards, sprints, issues, and projects
- YouTrack API client for communication with YouTrack instances
- MCP tools for various YouTrack operations
- Configuration via environment variables

## In Progress
- Memory bank documentation and context capture
- Detailed code review to understand implementation status
- Assessment of test coverage and quality

## What's Left to Build
This will be determined after deeper code exploration, but based on initial review:
- Possible enhancements to error handling
- Potential improvements to response formatting
- Additional tools for YouTrack functionality not yet covered
- Documentation updates and examples

## Current Status
- **Documentation**: In progress (Memory bank initialization)
- **Core Functionality**: Initial implementation appears complete
- **Testing**: Status unknown, needs review
- **Error Handling**: Unknown, needs assessment
- **Build Process**: Defined in package.json
- **Deployment**: Local development only for now

## Known Issues
No known issues have been identified yet as we're in the early exploration phase.
