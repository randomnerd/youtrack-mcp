# YouTrack MCP Progress

## What Works
Based on code review and testing, the project has implemented:
- Basic MCP server setup with the MCP protocol SDK
- Route registration for boards, sprints, issues, and projects
- YouTrack API client for communication with YouTrack instances
- MCP tools for various YouTrack operations
- Configuration via environment variables
- Comprehensive unit test suite with good coverage for models and controllers
- Integration tests for routes and API functionality

## In Progress
- Fixing failing tests in `issueRoutes.test.ts` similar to the successful fixes in `sprintRoutes.test.ts`
- Fixing failing tests in the YouTrack client (`youtrack.test.ts`) related to API error handling
- Improving test coverage for complex utility files, particularly `youtrack-json-formatter.ts`
- Enhancing branch coverage across the project, especially in route files and utilities

## What's Left to Build
Based on code review and test analysis:
- Apply route test fixes to remaining route files with similar issues
- Fix all remaining failing tests in the YouTrack API client
- Improve route test coverage (currently at 47.72% branch coverage)
- Further enhance test coverage for `youtrack-json-formatter.ts` (currently at 58.57%)
- Create more edge case tests for error handling paths

## Current Status
- **Documentation**: Memory bank is being updated with latest progress and test strategy
- **Core Functionality**: Implementation is complete and operational
- **Testing**: 
  - Overall statement coverage: 77.58%
  - Overall branch coverage: 59.14%
  - Overall function coverage: 86.97%
  - Overall line coverage: 80.20%
- **Error Handling**: Implemented with some areas that could use more testing
- **Build Process**: Defined in package.json with test scripts
- **Test Suite**: Jest with extensive test files, with many passing tests but still some failing tests in specific areas

## Known Issues
1. YouTrack API client tests have numerous failing tests related to error handling, mostly with "YouTrack API Error (404): undefined" errors
2. Issue routes tests still have failing tests related to parameter transformations and resource template URI access
3. Complex formatter (`youtrack-json-formatter.ts`) has relatively low coverage (~58.57%)
4. Branch coverage is still the weakest metric at 59.14% project-wide

## Recent Achievements
- Fixed `sprintRoutes.test.ts` tests by properly handling ResourceTemplate access and implementing correct testing for Zod schema transformations
- Created a dedicated `sprintRoutes.transform.test.ts` file to test transform functions independently
- Implemented a new approach for testing transformed parameters by manually applying transformations in tests
- Fixed resource template URI tests by properly checking ResourceTemplate instances
- Applied a pattern of returning options in mock implementations to verify transformed values
- Established a reusable pattern for testing route parameter validations that can be applied to other route files
