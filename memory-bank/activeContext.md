# YouTrack MCP Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently in the initialization phase. We are setting up the memory bank to maintain documentation and context between sessions.

## Recent Changes
No significant changes have been made yet as we've just begun the project documentation.

## Active Decisions
1. **Documentation Strategy**: Using the memory bank pattern to maintain project context
2. **Project Structure Analysis**: Understanding the existing codebase organization
3. **Architecture Documentation**: Documenting the layered architecture and component relationships

## Next Steps
1. Complete the memory bank initialization with all required files
2. Explore the codebase in more detail to understand implementation patterns
3. Document specific tools and their functionality
4. Identify any areas that need improvement or completion
5. Plan for future development tasks based on priorities

## Current Challenges
1. **Understanding Full Codebase**: Need to explore more of the implementation to understand all patterns
2. **Documenting Tool Behaviors**: Need to capture the functionality of each MCP tool accurately
3. **Identifying Missing Features**: Determine what additional features might be needed

## Open Questions
1. What is the current state of implementation? (Complete, in-progress, or planning phase)
2. Are there specific areas of the codebase that need immediate attention?
3. What testing has been completed so far?
4. Are there any known bugs or issues to address?
5. What are the priority features for future development?
