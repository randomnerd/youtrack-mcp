# YouTrack MCP Project Brief

## Project Overview
YouTrack MCP is a Model-Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides an interface to interact with a YouTrack instance. It allows users to query and manage various YouTrack entities such as agile boards, sprints, issues, and projects through a standardized MCP protocol.

## Core Requirements
1. Create an MCP server that connects to a YouTrack instance via API
2. Provide tools for managing agile boards, sprints, issues, and projects
3. Format YouTrack API responses as simplified JSON objects
4. Ensure proper error handling and validation
5. Support authentication to YouTrack via API tokens
6. Create a clean, well-documented API interface

## Goals
- Simplify interaction with YouTrack through structured MCP tools
- Reduce complexity of YouTrack API responses with a robust formatter
- Provide a standardized interface that can be used by AI assistants
- Enable programmatic management of YouTrack entities

## Scope
- **In Scope**: Agile boards, sprints, issues, and projects management
- **Out of Scope**: User management, custom field creation, workflow customization

## Success Criteria
- Complete implementation of all planned MCP tools
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation of all tools and resource templates
- Formatter that simplifies YouTrack API responses effectively
